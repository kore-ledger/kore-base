# Kore Base

Kore Base is a library that provides the basic types and functions to build a **Kore Ledger** node.

**Kore Ledger** is a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) designed and built specifically for traceability of assets and processes’ provenance and life cycle. It is complemented by a framework and governance model that facilitates interaction and cooperation between multiple actors in highly complex scenarios (circular economy, energy production, integral water cycle, agri-food production, etc.). The word **kore** means “green” in the African language Hausa, and represents one of its design principles: sustainability. Other principles, such as scalability to handle billions of transactions, the ability for nodes to run on low-resource devices, and multi-scheme cryptography to protect information and make it immune to manipulation, make Kore Ledger a strategic platform to achieve the [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/).
